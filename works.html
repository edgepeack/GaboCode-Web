                    <p>This project involved creating a command-line antivirus in Python.
                        The application implements a scanning engine that analyzes files for
                        known malware signatures. Functionalities were included to quarantine
                        or delete infected files, as well as to generate scan reports. The goal
                        was to understand the basic principles of malware detection and computer security.</p>
